# Custom Charts

There's a chart editor called [MercuryMapper](https://github.com/Yasu3D/MercuryMapper). 

Check out the [MercuryMapper Tutorial](https://siamesederp.github.io/MercuryMapper-Tutorial/) to learn how to chart!

There also exists a browser-based chart visualizer called [MercuryPlayer](https://yellowberryhn.github.io/MercuryPlayer/), which can be used to view charts without
opening them up in an editor. A nice way to preview charts made by others. The version linked specifically has support
for previewing charts on a cab, if you so desire for whatever reason. It also has all the charts in the base game
available to preview, without audio.
